## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Context |
|------|----------|---------|
| 2026-02-06 | 8-phase roadmap covering 25 v1 requirements | Comprehensive depth, schema-first approach |
| 2026-02-06 | Phases 3 and 5 flagged for research | AI extraction and material normalization are highest-risk |
| 2026-02-06 | v2 features deferred: email, Excel, NL queries, alerts, analytics, team access | Focus v1 on PDF upload -> extraction -> review -> search pipeline |
| 2026-02-06 | Excluded price_alerts and query_log tables from v1 schema | v2 features per plan scope |
| 2026-02-06 | TIMESTAMPTZ for all timestamps, gen_random_uuid() for UUIDs | Timezone-aware, native PostgreSQL 13+ |
| 2026-02-06 | line_items RLS via JOIN to quotes (no direct org_id) | Inherits organization scope from parent quote |
| 2026-02-06 | category_attributes JSONB on materials for extensibility | Non-lumber categories (windows, cabinets) use JSONB for custom fields |
| 2026-02-06 | shadcn v3.8 uses shadcn/tailwind.css import pattern | Runtime dep required, newer than traditional cn()-only setup |
| 2026-02-06 | Path alias @/ for all imports | Configured in tsconfig + vite.config for clean imports |
| 2026-02-06 | React Query staleTime 5 minutes, retry 1 | Balance between freshness and network efficiency |
| 2026-02-06 | Connected to Ross Built Price Analyzer Supabase project | xgpjwpwhtfmbvoqtvete.supabase.co |
| 2026-02-06 | Edge Function trigger instead of pg_cron for v1 job processing | Simpler for single-user; claim_pending_document() still supports concurrent workers if needed later |
| 2026-02-06 | No react-dropzone — native HTML5 drag events | Minimizes dependencies; drag-and-drop is simple enough without a library |
| 2026-02-09 | Converted Database row types from interface to type alias | TypeScript interfaces do not satisfy Record<string, unknown> required by Supabase client GenericSchema |
| 2026-02-09 | Storage paths use {org_id}/{uuid}_{filename} pattern | Organizational hygiene for future multi-tenant scoping |
