<objective>
Install Recharts, create the data-fetching hooks for reports, build the ReportsPage skeleton with filter panel and summary stat cards, and wire up routing and navigation.

Purpose: Establishes all foundation for the analytics dashboard -- chart library available, data flowing, filters working, stats visible. Plans 02 and 03 add chart components into this page.
Output: A functional /reports page with working filters and stat cards but no charts yet (charts come in Plans 02 and 03).

    **Step 1: Install Recharts**

    Run `npm install recharts` inside the `material-price-intel/` directory. Recharts is a lightweight, composable React charting library built on D3. It works natively with React 19 and has zero config -- just import components. Do NOT install @types/recharts (Recharts ships its own types).

    **Step 2: Create `src/hooks/useReportsData.ts`**

    Create a dedicated data hook file for the reports page. Follow the same patterns as `useMaterials.ts` -- named exports, React Query with 5-min staleTime, supabase client from `@/lib/supabase`.

    The hook `useReportsData()` should:
    1. Query `line_items` table with joins to `quotes`, `suppliers`, and `materials` (via material_id FK)
    2. Only include line items that have a `material_id` (not null) AND a `unit_price` (not null) -- unlinked items have no analytical value
    3. Only include line items from verified quotes (`is_verified = true`) -- unverified data should not appear in analytics
    4. Select these fields:
       - From line_items: `id, raw_description, quantity, unit, unit_price, line_total, material_id`
       - From quotes (via join): `id, quote_date, quote_number, project_name, supplier_id`
       - From suppliers (via quotes join): `id, name`
       - From materials (via material_id): `id, canonical_name, category_id`
    5. Flatten the joined response into a typed array. Define the type inline in the hook file:

    ```typescript
    export type ReportDataPoint = {
      lineItemId: string;
      rawDescription: string;
      quantity: number | null;
      unit: string | null;
      unitPrice: number;        // guaranteed non-null by filter
      lineTotal: number | null;
      quoteId: string;
      quoteDate: string | null;
      quoteNumber: string | null;
      projectName: string | null;
      supplierId: string;
      supplierName: string;
      materialId: string;       // guaranteed non-null by filter
      canonicalName: string;    // guaranteed non-null by filter
      categoryId: string | null;
    };
    ```

    6. Order by quote_date ascending (chronological for charting)

    Also export `useReportsCategories()` and `useReportsSuppliers()` hooks -- these can be identical to the ones in SearchPage.tsx (query `material_categories` ordered by sort_order, and `suppliers` ordered by name). Extracting them into this shared hook file avoids duplication. Use the same query keys: `["material_categories"]` and `["suppliers_list"]` so React Query deduplicates if both pages are mounted.

    Also export `useReportsMaterials()` -- a lightweight hook that queries the `materials` table for just `id, canonical_name, category_id` where `is_active = true`, ordered by `canonical_name`. This populates the material filter dropdown. Query key: `["materials_for_filter"]`.

    1. Run `cd material-price-intel && npx tsc --noEmit` -- no TypeScript errors
    2. Run `cd material-price-intel && npm run build` -- build succeeds
    3. Verify `recharts` appears in package.json dependencies
    4. Verify `useReportsData.ts` exports: `useReportsData`, `useReportsCategories`, `useReportsSuppliers`, `useReportsMaterials`, `ReportDataPoint`

  <name>Task 2: Create ReportsPage with filters and stat cards, wire route and nav</name>

    material-price-intel/src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    **Step 1: Create `src/pages/ReportsPage.tsx`**

    Follow the existing page pattern: `export function ReportsPage()`. Use the same component imports as SearchPage/DashboardPage (Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle, Button, Input, Label from shadcn; Lucide icons; supabase from @/lib/supabase).

    The page structure:

    **Header:**
    ```
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Reports</h2>
    <p class="text-muted-foreground mt-2">Price trends and supplier comparison analytics</p>
    ```

    **Filter Panel (always visible, no toggle):**
    A Card containing a grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-5 gap-4) with these filters:
    1. **Material Category** -- `<select>` dropdown populated from `useReportsCategories()`. Options: "All Categories" + each category. When changed, reset material filter to "all".
    2. **Specific Material** -- `<select>` dropdown populated from `useReportsMaterials()`, filtered by selected category. Options: "All Materials" + each material.
    3. **Supplier** -- `<select>` dropdown from `useReportsSuppliers()`. Options: "All Suppliers" + each supplier.
    4. **Date From** -- `<input type="date">` for start date range.
    5. **Date To** -- `<input type="date">` for end date range.

    Use the same select styling as SearchPage: `className="h-9 w-full rounded-md border border-input bg-transparent px-3 py-1 text-sm shadow-xs"`

    Add a "Clear Filters" button (variant="ghost", with X icon from lucide) that appears when any filter is active.

    **Filter state:** Use `useState` for each filter. Create a `useMemo` that filters the `useReportsData()` results based on all active filters:
    - categoryFilter: match `dataPoint.categoryId === categoryFilter`
    - materialFilter: match `dataPoint.materialId === materialFilter`
    - supplierFilter: match `dataPoint.supplierName === supplierFilter`
    - dateFrom: match `dataPoint.quoteDate >= dateFrom`
    - dateTo: match `dataPoint.quoteDate <= dateTo`
    - All default to empty string ("") meaning no filter

    **Summary Stat Cards:**
    A grid (grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4) below the filters with 4 cards computed from filtered data:

    1. **Average Price** -- Mean of all unitPrice values in filtered set. Display with `$X.XX` format. Use Lucide `DollarSign` icon with blue-100 bg / blue-600 text.

    2. **Price Trend** -- Compare average price of most recent 50% of data points (by date) vs oldest 50%. If recent > old by >5%, show TrendingUp (red icon, "Rising"). If recent < old by >5%, show TrendingDown (green icon, "Falling"). Otherwise show Minus (slate icon, "Stable"). Display the percentage change.

    3. **Best Supplier** -- Supplier with the lowest average unit price across filtered set. Display supplier name. Use Lucide `Award` icon with green-100 bg / green-600 text. If no data, show "--".

    4. **Quote Count** -- Count of unique quoteId values in filtered set. Use Lucide `FileText` icon with slate-100 bg / slate-600 text.

    Use the same stat card pattern as SearchPage (Card > CardContent with flex items-center gap-3, icon in colored rounded-lg div, text beside it).

    **Chart placeholder:**
    Below the stat cards, add a single Card with CardHeader "Price Trends" and CardContent containing a centered muted-foreground paragraph: "Chart loading..." (Plan 02 will replace this with the actual Recharts chart). Give this card an id or a clear comment like `{/* CHART PLACEHOLDER - replaced in Plan 02 */}`.

    **Loading state:**
    While `useReportsData()` is loading, show a centered Loader2 spinner with "Loading analytics data..." text, same pattern as SearchPage.

    **Empty state:**
    If filtered data has 0 results, show an empty state Card with BarChart3 icon and message "No price data matches your filters. Try broadening your selection." or if no filters are active: "No verified price data yet. Upload and approve quotes to see analytics."

    **Step 2: Add route to App.tsx**

    Import `ReportsPage` from `@/pages/ReportsPage` and add a Route:
    ```tsx
    <Route path="/reports" element={<ReportsPage />} />
    ```
    Place it after the `/search` route, still inside the ProtectedRoute > AppLayout nesting.

    **Step 3: Add nav item to AppLayout.tsx**

    Import `BarChart3` from `lucide-react` and add to the navItems array:
    ```typescript
    { to: "/reports", label: "Reports", icon: BarChart3 },
    ```
    Place it after the Search entry (last item before the sidebar footer).

    1. Run `cd material-price-intel && npx tsc --noEmit` -- no TypeScript errors
    2. Run `cd material-price-intel && npm run build` -- build succeeds
    3. Verify ReportsPage.tsx exports `ReportsPage`
    4. Verify App.tsx has `/reports` route
    5. Verify AppLayout.tsx navItems includes "Reports" with BarChart3 icon
    6. Grep ReportsPage.tsx for: useReportsData, useReportsCategories, useReportsSuppliers, useReportsMaterials (all 4 hooks used)
    7. Grep ReportsPage.tsx for: "Average", "Trend", "Best Supplier", "Quote Count" (all 4 stat cards present)
  </verify>
  <done>
    ReportsPage renders with working filter panel (5 filters: category, material, supplier, date from, date to) and 4 summary stat cards computed from filtered data. Route /reports is accessible. Sidebar shows "Reports" link with BarChart3 icon. Chart area is placeholder -- ready for Plan 02. Build passes cleanly.
